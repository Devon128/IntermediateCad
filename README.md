### Reflection
"I learned when doing this assignment that there are a lot of helpful tools on CAD that i wish i used when i 1st started.Things would have been easier, so here goes some helpful tools and shortcuts that i learned.
"One of the tools i learned how to use that is helpful is the Use Tool. This tool is what you would use for your geometry,edges or your silhouetts your parts and sketches to bring them onto your active sketch.Shortcut for it is U.
"I also learned more about the Revolve tool, Like i understand what it does now.We use this tool to revovle 2D geometry partially or fully around an axis to make some kinds of complex geometry.
"I also learned about what the purpose was for the Hole tool.I found out that this tool is helpful when making holes because it allows us users to change the hole based on common standards and hole types.
